# Orbis Usage Dashboards with Power Automate

**Description:**

Developed cloud-based data pipelines to automate the refresh of Orbis API and export option usage data for Power BI dashboards. This project leveraged Power Automate to orchestrate data extraction from SQL Server, ensuring up-to-date insights into platform utilization and user behavior. The dashboards provide critical business intelligence, enabling data-driven decision-making regarding Orbis platform usage.

**Key Technologies:**

* Python (Orbis API interaction)
* SQL Server
* Power BI
* Power Automate
* Cloud Data Warehouse: **Azure SQL Database (or similar if applicable)**
* API Management: **Azure API Management (or similar if applicable)**
* Version Control: **Git**

**Project Overview:**

* **Data Extraction:** Developed Python scripts to extract Orbis API and export option usage data from internal logs and load it into SQL Server.
* **Data Transformation and Loading:** Implemented SQL queries to transform and load the data into appropriate tables within SQL Server, preparing it for Power BI consumption.
* **Power BI Dashboard Creation:** Designed and developed interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize key metrics related to Orbis API and export option usage, including usage trends, user activity, and performance indicators.
* **Power Automate Orchestration:** Created Power Automate flows to automate the data refresh process, scheduling regular data extraction and updates to the Power BI datasets.
* **Cloud Data Warehouse Integration (If Applicable):** If utilizing Azure SQL Database or similar, ensured seamless data transfer and synchronization between SQL Server and the cloud data warehouse.
* **API Management Integration (If Applicable):** If utilizing Azure API Management or similar, ensured proper API endpoint management and secure access to data.
* **Monitoring and Error Handling:** Implemented monitoring and error handling within Power Automate flows to ensure data integrity and timely notifications in case of failures.

# Automated Data Refresh for Platform Usage Dashboards

**Description:**

Developed cloud-based data pipelines to automate the refresh of platform usage data for business intelligence dashboards. This project leveraged workflow automation tools to orchestrate data extraction from a database, ensuring up-to-date insights into platform utilization and user behavior. The dashboards provide critical business intelligence, enabling data-driven decision-making regarding platform usage.

**Key Technologies:**

* Python (API interaction)
* SQL (Database interaction)
* Business Intelligence Tool (e.g., Power BI)
* Workflow Automation Tool (e.g., Power Automate)
* Cloud Data Warehouse (e.g., Azure SQL Database, AWS Redshift)
* API Management (e.g., Azure API Management, AWS API Gateway)
* Version Control: Git

**Project Overview:**

* **Data Extraction:** Developed Python scripts to extract platform usage data from internal logs and load it into a database.
* **Data Transformation and Loading:** Implemented SQL queries to transform and load the data into appropriate tables within the database, preparing it for dashboard consumption.
* **Dashboard Creation:** Designed and developed interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics related to platform usage, including usage trends, user activity, and performance indicators.
* **Workflow Automation:** Created automated workflows to automate the data refresh process, scheduling regular data extraction and updates to the dashboard datasets.
* **Cloud Data Warehouse Integration (If Applicable):** If utilizing a cloud data warehouse, ensured seamless data transfer and synchronization between the source database and the cloud data warehouse.
* **API Management Integration (If Applicable):** If utilizing API management, ensured proper API endpoint management and secure access to data.
* **Monitoring and Error Handling:** Implemented monitoring and error handling within automated workflows to ensure data integrity and timely notifications in case of failures.

**Key Achievements:**
